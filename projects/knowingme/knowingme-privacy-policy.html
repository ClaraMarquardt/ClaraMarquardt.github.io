		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">The KnowingMe team built the KnowingMe app as a free and open source Web and Desktop app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use "as is".</p>
		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">This page is used to inform app users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;"><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">For a better experience while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information and/or to authorize us to request certain personally identifiable information from third-party providers on your behalf, including but not limited to:
		<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">
		    <li>Your email address and basic Gmail account information (your full name and profile picture);</li>
		    <li>Your sent and received emails (including their text, metadata, and associated sender/receiver contact information) over a pre-specified period.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">The information that we request is processed as follows:
		<ul style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">
		    <li><b>Desktop App:</b> All requested data is stored and analyzed on your computer. No data is collected, analyzed or retained by us in any other form or in any other location. 

		    <br><br>The requested data will persist on your computers until the app is properly terminated, a process requiring you to, at the minimum, (i) log out of the app, confirming your intent to reset the app when prompted; (ii) close the browser window in which the app is running; (iii) terminate the Docker container in which the app is being executed; and (iv) delete the user-designated data folder.</li>
		    <br>
		    
		    <li><b>Web App:</b> All requested data is stored and analyzed on a web server hosted by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Servers (AWS)</a> (additional information is available at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AWS Privacy</a>). No data is collected, analyzed or retained by us in any other form or in any other location. The requested data is stored in a user-session-specific directory which is accessible only to (a) administrators with access to the web server and (b) other individuals with access to the randomly-generated, 36-digit & character identifier which uniquely identifies each user-session. 
		    
		    <br><br>The requested data will persist on the server until the app is properly terminated, a process requiring you to, at the minimum, (i) log out of the app, confirming your intent to reset the app when prompted; and, (ii) close the browser window in which the app is running. In case of a non-termination of the app, the data will be retained until the web server is rebooted as part of (i) an unscheduled maintenance effort or (ii) a scheduled, daily downtime.</li>

		</ul>

		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">Any authorizations you provide to enable the KnowingMe app to request personally identifiable information on your behalf can be revoked at any time.

		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in case of an error in the app we collect data and information (through third-party products) called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

		<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:400px; padding-right:400px;">This Service does not use these "cookies" explicitly.
